There are many differences and issues when trying to render an HTML5 creative under different platform/browsers.
  1. Fonts might look or **be** different
  2. CSS / layout differences
  3. Animation / timing differences

This tool tries to address the first 2 points above by doing image comparison of an HTML5 creative tag under different 
platform/browser configurations

## Setup
Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:paperg/tagcompare.git`
`python setup.py install` to install it.  
`which tagcompare` should show that it's installed

### settings.json
Make a local copy of [`settings.json`](tagcompare/settings.json) called `settings.local.json`
Update all the `null` values for saucelabs and placelocal:
```json
  "saucelabs": {
    "user": null,
    "key": null
  },
  "placelocal": {
    "domain": "www.placelocaldemo.com",
    "secret": {
      "pl-secret": null,
      "pl-service-identifier": null
    }
  }
```

Update the `settings.local.json` file with the desired input to the tool as desired

## Running the tool
`tagcompare` is the main entry point for the tool, it will capture and compare tags 
with the given input in your `settings.local.json`

All outputs generated by the tool will be stored in `/tmp/tagcompare`

## Running tests
`make test` or `tox` will run unit tests
`make test-all` will run all the tests
